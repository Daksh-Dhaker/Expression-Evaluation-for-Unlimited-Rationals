Designed a program that takes a sequence of variable assignment expressions in which one variable can be used in later assignments. These rationals have the form p/q where p and q can have very large values (greater than the biggest integral Data type in c++ so implemented using array of digits). Expression evaluation is done using the ideas of Parser trees and symbol tables (BST for quick retrieval of values of variables).
